# project-example-v0.1

Example of NASA project with a complete set of most of the planned features. The Materialize framework is used for the front-end, while Spring is used for the back-end. The current set of features includes:

* Reading a JSON file, then converting it into a Java object
* Capability to support multiple question types like multiple choice, checkbox, etc.
* Populating the HTML templetes according to each specific Assessment content

Future features to be added:
* Adding text input questions type
* Javascript validation for text input. Might implement with Spring instead.
